The basketball stars talk about the victims of the recent shootings such as Michael Brown, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and how people have to stop thinking in a \"shoot-to-kill mentality\". These are names of people that I have heard before even though I am not in the US, and it seems that the rates of gun shootings against African-Americans are increasing day by day. Racism that has been going on in the US has been horrifying, especially because all these victims were innocent. I think it is important that people who can impact communities around the world such as these NBA players should stand against these types of racial and violent issues, since these people have the power to make changes in the world. These NBA players represent African-Americans who are not impactful enough, and I hope that they could be the lead in making a difference in police brutality in the US. Furthermore, I thought this article was important because the recent gun shootings starts to question the justice of the police officers in the US. I am not saying that all police officers are bad, but I think it is important to lessen the use of guns.

What I question is whether Portugal deserved it or not. In my opinion, Portugal did not deserve to win this tournament because they played anti-soccer for the majority of the tournament. Anti-soccer is basically when a team just sits back and defends instead of actually attempting to attack. Even with Cristiano Ronaldo, their star attacker, Portugal played boring football for most of the knockout rounds. They either advanced in extra-time or penalties. In addition, Portugal did not manage to win a single game in the regulation 90 minutes up until the semi-finals against Wales. That is absolutely terrible for a winner of the Euros. To add to all of this, Portugal finished third in their group behind Iceland and Hungary. If this was the old format of the Euros, they would've been out. Also, they faced some weak competition in reaching the final in Croatia, Poland, and Wales. On the other hand, France had to beat Germany 2-0 to reach the final. While I was watching the final, France created many more chances than Portugal did, and they deserved to win on home soil. What made me even angrier was when Ronaldo got all the credit for winning the match when he was injured for most of the game, and his teammates did all the hard work. Ronaldo didn't even contribute to Portugal winning in the final game.

He needs to rally his countrymen, and sharing a common enemy gives strength and motivation to all. The rebel soldiers themselves lacked organization and skill. The soldiers themselves were cowardly, they fell easily to government forces and were quickly subdued by police. By morning, the government had regained control and the President who hours before was hiding behind the safety of a FaceTime camera, stood atop a bus celebrating the success of his government.

Pokemon Go is a real life game where you have to travel around to try and find then catch Pokemon and then upgrade and evolve them. The big difference between this new game and the old ones that are on the Gameboys and DS's is that you have to move around in real life for your avatar in the game to move, you can't just use arrow keys to move in the game. This part is what makes the game so fun because people get to travel around and act like they are trying to find the pokemon in real life so it feels more like you are actually doing the actions. Also it is so popular because its Pokemon most people love Pokemon because it reminds them of when they are kids. In this article it talks about how it is getting kids and people off the couch and moving which is something that not many games can claim to make people want to exercise or go for walks. This articale was claiming though that it might not be for the best because if families go on vacation then kids will focus on just finding Pokemon and not on the things they are there to visit. I think that this game has way more positives than negatives because like the article send it is getting people to exercise and even getting friends and families to hang out more and want to spend more time together.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3455765, "replies": [], "lft": 320, "assetURL": "http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/summer-reading-contest-week-5-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week-2/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 19178899, "rgt": 321, "userDisplayName": "sophiesmv2021", "createDate": "1468787885", "userID": 76134290, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1468814717", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1468811117", "commentSequence": 19178899, "commentBody": "<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/police-shooting-in-baton-rouge/nobody-is-right-here\" title=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/police-shooting-in-baton-rouge/nobody-is-right-here\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nytimes.com/live/police-shooting-in-baton-rouge/nobody-is-rig...</a><br/>     When someone is killed, their loved ones who are left behind are going to feel grief, no matter their skin color.

I think Summer camps are an awesome way to make a lot of new friends and to be able to get away from your parents for a short amount of time. A really cool thing that caught my eye about this article is how many different kinds of Summer camps there are all over the world and for all different kinds of people with the same exact interests. Another really interesting thing about Summer camps is they vary in all different lengths. For example, some Summer camps are only for a few hours and some are for two whole months! By having gone to a Summer camp before, I could understand what they meant a lot more and was able to relate it to the camp that  I went to just last month. Summer camps are not only a great way to create bonds, but also during Summer camps you learn a lot of new and super interesting things. To conclude, I truly think that Summer camps are an amazing way to get to know new people, create stronger bonds with people you already know, and an even better way to learn all sorts of new and useful things.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3455765, "replies": [], "lft": 326, "assetURL": "http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/summer-reading-contest-week-5-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week-2/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 19179449, "rgt": 327, "userDisplayName": "Syd G", "createDate": "1468791441", "userID": 75984805, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1468814717", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Omaha, NE", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1468811117", "commentSequence": 19179449, "commentBody": "The \u201cPillow talk with a professional cuddler\u201d interested me the most this week because I am not a big fan of cuddling..

A professional cuddler alone sounds insane, but to have to train to become one seems more absurd.

The people mid 30s-40s are generally either trying to have kids or have kids currently. Some other responsibilities for the whole group of people would possibly be having to take care of their parents or grandparents. Not to mention, some responsibilities anyone that lives on their on has to deal with such as; jobs, mortgages/rent payments, groceries, and clothing.

Unfortunately children from many different ages were killed too by getting lost in the chaos. One girl at the age of 14 was separated from her family and after a lot of searching her family found her dead. All these recent attacks in France can have an effect on children and I think that it will cause many parents to watch more out for their children.<br/>I believe that these attacks are caused to show power from the group enacting them. They would like to prove themselves to other people and create fear. Especially in situations like this, it is important to be aware of the goals of the group that is attacking in order to keep oneself from being a victim. Standing strong together and people working with each other and not against each other, can make a difference and show the attacking group that they are too weak to survive. After the attacks families gathered and said goodbye to all of the people lost.<br/>Even though I find these attacks horrifying, it happened for a reason and I believe through these events people will stick together and try to help each other more than earlier.

If everyone gives up the right to bear arms that would in theory make us safer as Patchett has said, but criminals will still find a way to attain guns leaving the good guys helpless against the bad guys. This brought up the point of why there have been so many shooting in theaters and other places that have no gun policies. The good guys, the policy and security, are helpless because they follow the rules where the shooters didn\u2019t. Patchett had a point that guns do kill people and the danger is very real even if you just have them in your house. In a perfect world everyone, good and bad, would give up their guns and unfortunately this isn\u2019t the perfect world we want. There are ways to avoid these scenarios by having more metal detectors in public places or having higher security everywhere.

They both start to realize towards the end that their food is no longer good quality and team up together to make organic fresh food instead.

Summer camp is magical, a place where messes are encouraged and you are challenged to always say \"yes\". It is an escape from harsh reality and the pressures of society, and I always return home feeling rested and renewed. Though I don't attend a French summer camp, I was able to relate to the majority of the activities mentioned. Time flew by, and I wish that I could've stayed for 8 weeks like the author did at her camp. Camp is so good for the human soul is because it reconnects us to our most basic origins. The beauty of a sparkling lake or tall, looming evergreens is an insane and magical beauty. Nothing manmade can recreate that magic and often times, humans don't see enough of it. There is a reason we are so intrigued by sunsets, shooting stars and the first snowfall of the winter. We can't fully explain or understand nature's recipes or timelines, and these random and imperfect phenomena easily stand out against cement sidewalks and brick buildings.

Many adults think of us as trouble makers and risk takers, but that's not completely true. I learned, that since 1991, teenagers are less likely to conceal a weapon, do drugs, drink, or get sexually involved. Although the use of marijuana has increased, it's not a significant amount to act on. Studies show that teens act more responsibly around adults than if around their friends. Because of this, restrictions on driving have been made, like limiting the amount of passengers in a car or setting curfews. The article suggests that parents don't nag on their teens about where they're going or what they are doing, rather tell them to call if something comes up. In contrast, I do not totally agree with the statement that teenagers are less likely to do something if their parents talk to them about the dangers. I know many kids just want to rebel against their parents so listening is the opposite of what they'll do. From experience, I listen more to my teachers or speakers in health class about the dangers of illegal/risky behavior because I trust what they say more since they deal with the topics frequently. Overall, I was shocked to learn that our generation really isn't as bad as they say.
