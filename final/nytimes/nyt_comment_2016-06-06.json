McMansions with 10' Ceilings. ( The houses from the 50's to 80's only have 8' ceilings and 4/12 roof pitches.  Which makes them smaller volumes.) Bravo's infamous Chateau Sheree is less than 1 mile south or mine. Surrounding it are other examples of the new larger rebuilds with million dollar price tags. <br/><br/>I and several of my neighbors in our little 20 home enclave have simply chosen to rework the original space or pop out Master bath additions. I took two small bedrooms and combined them for a Master Bedroom Suite. Then closed off the odd jack n Jill baths, so now the remaining two bedrooms each have their own. I am in process of converting the outdated formal living into a first floor bedroom and bath. I will still have a great room which I opened the kitchen to the first week. The grand piano room is a versatile office/den for us.  The only limiting factor is the 8' ceilings. <br/><br/>I just have to fight to keep my tax appraisal down with the tax man.

The Margery/Olenna/Sparrow subplot was so plodding for what it achieved; they could have wrapped up that little bit of plot advancement in less than half the time. Sansa and Jon going door-to-door looking for armies was oddly absurd, although it did provide the episodes's one highlight--little Lady Lyanna. The Hound's return has potential but seeing Ian McShane's character gone as quickly as he arrived was depressing even for a show with so much death. The episode even ended early.

The music? A Geneva jazz harmonica player named Gregoire Maret and his self-titled 2012 CD. The food pairings succeeded: best with the fruit and cheese; very good with the smoked salmon and pork; satisfactory with the cherry tomatoes.<br/><br/>As for the wine itself, I would describe the color as a very pale salmon-pink. The nose: cherry, raspberry, strawberry, floral, and a real surprise--mineral, like the Austrian Rieslings of a few months ago. The taste: same as the nose, plus what I can only describe as pomegranate. Most interesting: the crisp, high acid body and the mineral character, which really helps the wine stand up to, and augment, the cheese, salmon and meats. Would probably work with a baked or grilled whole fish.<br/><br/>In honor of my 13th anniversary, I improvised a cocktail. Muddle two sliced strawberries and 8 raspberries in the bottom of a pint glass. Add 6 ounces of the Peyrassol or other Rose. Fill with seltzer, stir gently to float the fruit, add a few ice cubes.

Last we left her, she was in the dark waiting for the Waif. She didn't even look like herself this week. I almost half-expected her to be someone else. I had this wild idea that the Waif was going to do something horrible in her body and get her killed. It didn't make sense when I thought of it, but I just couldn't reconcile this scene with last week. <br/><br/>Also, the whole scene with the Hound and his marry bend of pacifists was pretty comical in some ways. It was pretty heavy-handed and you knew immediately what was going to happen to all of them. I think if the showrunners let the scene breathe, it would have been more impactful. As it was, it was almost too fast for emotional impact.", "recommendationCount": 26}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}
