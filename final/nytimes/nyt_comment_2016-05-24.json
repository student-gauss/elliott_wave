Rock books are ubiquitous.<br/>However, 300 years ago there was something called the \"classical era\" which included Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, to name a few of the obscure--you wouldn't have heard of them--composers. And what is the state of classical era music today? Is it still played at live concerts and on recordings? Does anybody know anything about it (did someone say sonata form)? Do we have to choose Mozart over Haydn over early Beethoven as the sole proprietor or can we sprinkle in some J.C. Bach or C.P.E. Bach or Muzio Clementi? <br/><br/>Rock music is going to be fine. In 300 years people will no doubt be composing \"neo-acid rock\" if they haven't already.", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 3453054, "replies": [], "lft": 2200, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/magazine/which-rock-star-will-historians-of-the-future-remember.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 18620527, "rgt": 2201, "userDisplayName": "Recoil Rob", "createDate": "1464061962", "userID": 39263248, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1464062707", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "<br/>", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1464059107", "commentSequence": 18620527, "commentBody": "Not Chuck, sorry, probably Keith Richards if looking for an individual, The Who for a group.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3453054, "replies": [], "lft": 2202, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/magazine/which-rock-star-will-historians-of-the-future-remember.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 18620529, "rgt": 2203, "userDisplayName": "gm", "createDate": "1464061974", "userID": 69553439, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1464062707", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Brooklyn", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1464059107", "commentSequence": 18620529, "commentBody": "Hendrix", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 3453054, "replies": [], "lft": 2204, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/magazine/which-rock-star-will-historians-of-the-future-remember.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 18620545, "rgt": 2205, "userDisplayName": "Marc Helfman", "createDate": "1464062195", "userID": 39232850, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1464062707", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Kenwood, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1464059107", "commentSequence": 18620545, "commentBody": "Even though this article doesn't spend much time on the reason rock became dominant, it was actually the invention of the teenager AND the invention of the transistor that made it happen. Before the transistor radio, adults had control of the bulky stationary radio console that doubled as a piece of furniture in the living room. But teenagers could take to their transistor radios to the beach and listen to whatever they wanted (which unbeknownst to them were rhythm and blues tunes appropriated from southern blacks), and eventually they had more power than the adults in determining what kind of music became popular.
