No, no one can have billions of dollars without someone else living in a ghetto. That's why our ghettos persist: we don't care. We're more interested in becoming rich and staying that way (or increasing our booty).<br/>My kids were so wonderful. Awesome and inspiring individuals. But, many worked after school, till midnight, many nights, and then came to school the next day. You say they have low literacy and low grades? Well, of course they do, we have them in school 7 hours a day and at work for 5! We're addicted to the idea of riches, which leads us down a dirty road of winners (few) and losers (many).

Millions of children do not have the parental support to succeed at school on their own.  That is why states, for the welfare of their citizens, undertook compulsory education actions beginning in the late 1800s.

This state action led to the creation of the middle class in the 1950s, mostly for white Americans.  Unfortunately, we have lost this commitment to one another and never had the same commitment to education for minorities and immigrants of color.
