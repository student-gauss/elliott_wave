My question for Bernie's supporters is, how will Bernie, if he gets elected, be able to completely change this dynamic, even with a Democratic Congress? Probably one third of Democrats are tied to moneyed interests and to regain the House there will certainly be a number of Blue Dogs added.  A revolution is not going to happen, and just wishing by his supporters isn't enough. Look at how difficult it has been for Obama to make even modest reforms.
