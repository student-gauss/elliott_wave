The one and only choice, for my family, is a plan that requires me to pay just under $600 a month with a $4,900 deductible.  And, except for routine checkups (allegedly), this $4,900 dollars has to be paid in full, by me, before the health insurance starts finding ways to \"legally\" weasel out of paying one red cent.  (And I say \"allegedly\" on the \"free\" checkups because they've never actually paid for any checkup.)  And even if they do pay one red cent, it's after they \"claim\" that the health costs were too high (not a \"customary\" charge) and cut them down to about 25% of what was actually charged so I have to pay the \"overcharge\", and then they expect me to pay 20% of the 25% of what they actually did pay (if they don't find some other way to weasel out of that too).  How do they know what \"customary\" charges should be?  UnitedHealthcare owns the corporation that decides what \"customary\" charges should be.  So a health insurance corporation decides what's a fair amount for health insurance corporations to pay the doctors, hospitals and clinics.

I suggest that before you turn 65 you do some serious research.<br/><br/>However, I will say that both Medicare and some Medigap plans also have deductibles. Medicare Part B -- the part that covers doctor expenses -- has an annual deductible of a couple hundred dollars (Part A -- the hospital part of Medicare, has much higher deductibles). Once that Part B deductible is met, Medicare pays 80% of covered expenses. One of the things \"Medigap\" plans typically cover is that 20% that one has to pay out of pocket. However, the Medigap plan I have -- the high deductible version of Medigap Plan F -- only kicks in once I have paid more than $2,000 out of pocket under Medicare. In return I get a much lower premium than I would pay for an unrestricted Plan F. For my first 3 years of coverage under this plan my premium remain unchanged. This year it dropped by $6 a month, i assume because NY is a community-rated state and lower claims experience under this type of plan called for lower premiums."}]}, "lft": 158, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/upshot/the-big-problem-with-high-health-care-deductibles.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 17473974, "rgt": 161, "userDisplayName": "flyoverland resident", "createDate": "1454735477", "userID": 60594370, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1454735527", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "kcmo", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1454735527", "commentSequence": 17473974, "commentBody": "I'm surprised this article never mentions the type of insurance available to older folks to fill in Medicare gaps and donut-holes.
